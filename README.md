# Welcome to Trang Do's Maze Program

### About this project

This project was programmed as an assignment for Northeastern University's classwork, specifically CS2510 Fundamentals of Computer Science 2.

The project constructs a maze based on the concept of a minimum spanning tree and proceeds to solve it via two approaches, depth-first search or
breadth-first search.

### Credits

The work is a collaboration between Trang Do and McKenna Guam. All references and resources are attributed to Northeastern University's 
CS2510 instructor team.
